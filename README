A cross-platform console-based flash tool for STC-51 microcontrollers.

This software requires my1codelib project at compile time.

I got most (if not all :p) information on STC bootloader interface from
stcdude (deprecated) and stcgal.

*Note* The following is for use in Slackware Linux only. Other distributions
may require alternative/other step(s).

The current Linux kernel driver (ch341.c) does not support parity control,
which is used by the bootloader in STC controllers. So, get 'patched' version
in res folder and copy that into '/usr/src/linux/drivers/usb/serial/' and
recompile the module.

Recompile the module:

	cd /usr/src/linux
	make M=drivers/usb/serial modules

Make sure to disconnect the cable and the module is not loaded

	rmmod ch341

Copy (i.e. 'install') the module into its expected location

	cp drivers/usb/serial/ch341.ko \
		/lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/usb/serial/

*Disclaimer* The source ch341.c is copied from Linux kernel tree for my
personal reference so that I can create proper patch when (and if) that code
is updated WITHOUT the required parity control code. Naturally, ch341_patched.c
is the patched ch341.c code.
